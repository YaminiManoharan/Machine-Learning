Topic:
Cohort characterisation and clustering

Project Description:
The goal of this investigation is to look into the features of a group of individuals who have severe hypotension. The goal of exploratory data analysis using k-means clustering is to discover patient subgroups or subphenotypes based on demographic information, comorbidity index, severity of disease scores, and patient outcomes (length of stay and in-ICU mortality). The discovery of these subphenotypes might give important insights into patient risk factors and appropriate personalised therapies.

Environment Configuration and Instructions:
Jupyter notebook is used to code and visualize.
1. Dependencies:
-Python 3.9 or above
-pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib are examples of libraries.

2. Setup:
-Check that Python is installed.
-Using pip, install the essential libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn and matplotlib.

3. Executing the Code:
-Place the dataset hypotension_patients.csv in the root directory or select the path for the file in the code.
-Start the Python script that contains the code.
-Visualisations and outcomes will be shown in the appropriate manner.
